This application supports both public and private messaging, with plans to introduce end-to-end encryption (E2EE) in the future. It allows users to register, log in, and communicate in real time using a client-server architecture. Public messages are visible to all users, while private messages are sent directly between them.


â€¢ As the project is still under production, this page will be updated when it enters the final stage.
